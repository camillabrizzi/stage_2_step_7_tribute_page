        <h1>Five reasons why I cannot get bored of them:</h1>

      <section>
        <h2>1. They still rock!</h2>
        <p> My Chemical Romance got reunited almost 3 years ago and have been touring again after postponing their shows due to the pandemic. They released a new single, 'Decay', in May 2022 and it's a banger! You can listen to it on this page. </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>2. They first got me into coding - kinda.</h2>
        <p> MySpace and VampireFreaks (ha!) gave me a first insight into HTML when I was a teen. I got to practice a little coding whilst I was an admin of the Italian My Chemical Romance fan-club. It was a big deal! </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>3. Nostalgia...</h2>
        <p>They say 'once an emo, always an emo'. I may have changed my wardrobe and makeup habits since (black is still my favourite colour), but my heart still flutters every time I hear their songs. Teenage angst, x-rated fanfictions, so many memories! MCR got me out of dark moments of my life and allowed me to chat to people all over the world. </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>4. They're simply iconic.</h2>
        <p> Their lyrics, music videos, fashion... Need I say more </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>5. I finally saw them live!</h2>
        <p> May 28th 2022 I realised my life-long dream of seeing them live, in Cardiff. The gig was all that I expected and more! Had an absolutely banging time, surrounded by emo oldies and got to overdo my eyeliner once again. I sang my heart out and cried too, of course. I cannot wait for their next tour.
          I remember when they came to Italy and my mother thought I was too young to travel to Milan to see them on my own. I cried and raged for a long time (sorry ma!).
